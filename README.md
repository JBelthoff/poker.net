## About John Belthoff’s Texas Hold’em & Poker Hand Evaluator

This project re-creates the logic and structure of a Texas Hold’em Poker game — from shuffling and dealing cards to evaluating hands and determining the winner.

The application is written in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and uses a **C# port of Cactus Kev’s Poker Hand Evaluator**, originally developed in C++.  
Although Cactus Kev’s original site is no longer online, a [copy of his article](https://poker-calculator.johnbelthoff.com/cactus_kev) is available on the live site for reference.

At this stage, the app:

- Simulates up to **9 players**
- **Rotates the dealer**
- **Calculates the winning hand**
- **Displays detailed results**

Future updates will continue refining gameplay and add more interactive features.

If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out — otherwise, enjoy exploring the source and the live demo!
