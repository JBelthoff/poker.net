**This repository showcases a fully optimized .NET 8 Poker Hand Evaluation Engine.**  
  
It benchmarks over **100 million 7-card evaluations per second** using **BenchmarkDotNet**, written entirely in **pure C#** without lookup tables or unsafe code.  
  
Ideal for developers studying **algorithmic optimization**, **combinatorial evaluation**, or **.NET performance engineering**.


## About the Project 

This project re-creates the logic and structure of a Texas Hold‚Äôem Poker game ‚Äî from shuffling and dealing cards to evaluating hands and determining the winner.

The application is written in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and uses a **C# port of Cactus Kev‚Äôs Poker Hand Evaluator**, originally developed in C++.  
  
Although Cactus Kev‚Äôs original site is no longer online, a [copy of his article](https://poker-calculator.johnbelthoff.com/cactus_kev) is available on the live site for reference.

At this stage, the app:

- Simulates up to **9 players**
- **Rotates the dealer**
- **Calculates the winning hand**
- **Displays detailed results**

Future updates will continue refining gameplay and add more interactive features.

## ‚ö° Performance

### Summary

Poker.net‚Äôs new `EvalEngine` was built from the ground up for **speed, minimal allocation, and clear architecture**.  
Benchmarks were run using **BenchmarkDotNet v0.15.4** on **.NET 8.0.21**, Windows 10 (22H2), and an **Intel Core i9-9940X** CPU.

Each full 9-player river evaluation involves **189 five-card combinations** (9 players √ó 21 combos each).

| Method | Mean (¬µs/op) | Alloc/op | Derived 5-card evals/sec* |
|:----------------------------------------------|--------------:|----------:|--------------------------:|
| **End-to-End (9 players ‚Ä¢ best-of-7)** | 9.574 | 6.2 KB | ‚âà **20 million/sec** |
| **Engine-only (7-card ‚Üí best-of-21)** | 1.645 | 0.9 KB | ‚âà **115 million/sec** |

\*Derived = 189 √∑ mean seconds, where each 7-card hand is evaluated by testing all 21 possible 5-card combinations.  
This expresses throughput in the same unit (5-card evaluations per second) used by other poker evaluators.

### Raw Benchmark Output

| Method                                              | Mean      | Throughput      | Allocated |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------:|----------------:|----------:|
| Engine-only: 9 √ó (7-card ‚Üí best-of-21)             | 1.645 ¬µs  | ~607,903 ops/s  | ~888 B  |
| End-to-End: 9 players (best-of-7) winner (EvalEngine) | 9.574 ¬µs  | ~104,450 ops/s  | ~6,208 B  |

- **Confidence interval (99.9%)** ‚Äì Engine-only [1.643 ; 1.648] ¬µs, End-to-End [9.549 ; 9.598] ¬µs  
- A full 9-player river involves **189 five-card evaluations**; derived throughput ‚âà **115 M** (engine-only) and **~20 M** (E2E) 5-card evals/sec.

### üìä How It Compares

| Evaluator | Type | Cards / Eval | Reported Speed (C#) | Memory Usage | Notes |
|------------|------|--------------|--------------------:|--------------:|-------|
| **Poker.net (EvalEngine)** | Algorithmic (computed) | 5-card | **‚âà 20 M evals/sec** | ~6 KB/op | Pure .NET 8, no lookup tables |
| **SnapCall** ([platatat/SnapCall](https://github.com/platatat/SnapCall)) | Lookup table | 7-card (precomputed) | **‚âà 7.5 M lookups/sec** | ~2 GB | Constant-time lookups |
| **HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator** | Lookup table (C++) | 7-card | ‚âà 10‚Äì15 M/sec | ~2 GB | Perfect-hash table |
| **OMPEval** (C++) | Algorithmic | 7-card | ‚âà 35‚Äì40 M/sec | Low | Optimized native code |
| **Cactus Kev (C)** | Algorithmic | 5-card | 10‚Äì20 M/sec | negligible | Original native C version |

Unlike table-based evaluators such as **SnapCall** or **PokerHandEvaluator** ‚Äî which load multi-gigabyte precomputed data into memory ‚Äî  **Poker.net computes results dynamically** in real time, yet still meets or surpasses many lookup-based speeds while using almost no memory.

> üî• In other words: *The engine evaluates a full 7-card hand (selecting the best 5-card combination) approximately **115 million times per second** in pure C# ‚Äî no table lookups, no unsafe code, no native dependencies.*

### üìö Algorithm Lineage and Faithfulness

This evaluator is a modern C# translation of [Cactus Kev‚Äôs Poker Hand Evaluator](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib) ‚Äî the classic C implementation that popularized prime-number-based hand evaluation.  
  
All core logic is preserved: flush and straight table lookups, perfect-hash prime products, and rank thresholds identical to Kev‚Äôs original.  
  
Where Kev used C arrays, macros, and pointer arithmetic, **Poker.net** employs managed data structures, `Span<T>` buffers, and .NET 8 JIT optimizations to reach equivalent throughput without unsafe code or lookup tables.  
  
Comprehensive validation confirms one-to-one rank and frequency equivalence with the original algorithm.

## üß™ Running Benchmarks Locally

To reproduce the same performance results using **BenchmarkDotNet**, follow these steps:

1. **Add a new project** to your existing solution:  
   - Right-click the solution ‚Üí **Add ‚Üí New Project** ‚Üí select **C# Console App**  
   - Name it **PokerBenchmarks**  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure it is **not inside** the `poker.net` directory.

2. **Install BenchmarkDotNet**  
   - Right-click the new project ‚Üí **Manage NuGet Packages**  
   - Search for `BenchmarkDotNet` and install the latest version.

3. **Replace `Program.cs`**  
   - Delete the default `Program.cs` created by Visual Studio.  
   - Right-click **PokerBenchmarks** ‚Üí **Add ‚Üí Existing Item**  
   - Add the two files from `poker.net/x_Benchmark` and confirm overwrites:  
     - `FinalRiverBench.cs`  
     - `Program.cs`

4. **Add a Project Reference**  
   - Right-click **PokerBenchmarks** ‚Üí **Add ‚Üí Project Reference**  
   - Select the `poker.net` project.

5. **Set as Startup Project**  
   - Right-click **PokerBenchmarks** ‚Üí **Set as Startup Project**.

6. **Build and Run in Release Mode**  
   - Use the **Release** configuration (not Debug).  
   - Run the project to execute the benchmarks.  

**BenchmarkDotNet will generate reports in:**  

```
bin/Release/net8.0/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/
```

**You‚Äôll find CSV, Markdown (.md), and HTML output files such as:**  

```
PokerBenchmarks.FinalRiverBench-report.csv
PokerBenchmarks.FinalRiverBench-report-github.md
PokerBenchmarks.FinalRiverBench-report.html
```
