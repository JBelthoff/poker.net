## About John Belthoff’s Texas Hold’em & Poker Hand Evaluator

This project began as a personal challenge to re-create the core logic behind a Texas Hold’em Poker game — from dealing and hand evaluation to determining the winner.

The application is written in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and relies on a **C# port of Cactus Kev’s Poker Hand Evaluator**, originally written in C++.  
Although Cactus Kev’s original webpage is no longer online, I’ve included a [copy of his article](https://poker-calculator.johnbelthoff.com/cactus_kev) for reference so you can follow along with his logic and mathematical approach.

At this stage, the program:

- Simulates up to **9 players**
- **Rotates the dealer**
- **Calculates the winning hand**
- **Displays detailed results**

There’s still room to expand the functionality into a complete, fully interactive poker experience — but the essential framework and logic are already in place.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.  
Otherwise, enjoy exploring the source and trying the live demo!
