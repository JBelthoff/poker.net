[![Throughput](https://img.shields.io/badge/Throughput-~189M%20hands%2Fs-brightgreen)]()

A modern **.NET 8/9 implementation** of the legendary [**Cactus Kev Poker Evaluator**](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib), rebuilt from the ground up for clarity, determinism, and speed.  

This version achieves **near-native C++ performance** through careful algorithmic refactoring, zero memory allocations, and extensive BenchmarkDotNet validation (see *Performance* section for verified benchmark data).

**This repository showcases a fully optimized .NET 8 Poker Hand Evaluation Engine**, implemented in **pure C#** without lookup tables or unsafe code. Estimated throughput, based on derived five-card evaluation counts from recent benchmarks, corresponds to roughly **170–190 million evaluations per second**, depending on workload (see *Performance* section for logs).

_All benchmarks were performed on an Intel Core i9-9940X (14-core, 28-thread) running Windows 10 (22H2) with .NET 8.0.21 under the High-Performance power plan._

Ideal for developers exploring **algorithmic optimization**, **combinatorial evaluation**, or **.NET performance engineering**.

### Summary of Verified Performance

| Language | Environment | Representative Throughput | Verification Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------:|--------------------:|
| **C++** | MSVC /O2 AVX2 64-bit | ~186–189 M 7-card hands/sec (≈ 5.3 ns/hand) | [Results-C++.txt](https://github.com/JBelthoff/PokerBenchmarks/blob/master/Results/Results-C++.txt) |
| **C# (.NET 8)** | RyuJIT 64-bit / Concurrent GC | ≈ 0.91–1.39 µs per 9-player evaluation (189 combos) | [Results-CSharp.txt](https://github.com/JBelthoff/PokerBenchmarks/blob/master/Results/Results-FinalRiverBench.txt) |

**Test Environment:** Intel Core i9-9940X (14 cores / 28 threads), Windows 10 (22H2), .NET 8.0.21 (Release x64), High-Performance power plan.  

All values above are **directly derived from benchmark logs** with **no extrapolation or inferred percentages.**  
Any further comparison (e.g., relative speed-ups or ratios) should be recalculated from these verified numbers.

## About the Project


This project re-creates the logic and structure of a full **Texas Hold’em Poker** game — from shuffling and dealing cards to evaluating hands and determining the winner.

The application is written in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and uses a modern C# port of [Cactus Kev’s Poker Hand Evaluator](https://poker-calculator.johnbelthoff.com/cactus_kev), the classic C implementation that popularized prime-number-based hand ranking.

At this stage, the app:

- Simulates **9 players**
- **Rotates the dealer**
- **Calculates the winning hand**
- **Displays detailed results**

Under the hood, the evaluation engine is optimized for high throughput and deterministic performance, maintaining fully managed, allocation-free execution.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

Clone and launch the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBelthoff/poker.net.git
cd poker.net
dotnet run
```

> **Tip:**  
> After running `dotnet run`, check the console log for the exact URL (“Now listening on…”).  
> Then open that URL (usually `https://localhost:5001`) in your browser.  
>
> **Note:**  
> By default, the app runs in No-DB (Static) mode using an in-memory deck.  
> To enable SQL Server support for recording games, set `"UseSqlServer": true` in your configuration and ensure SQL Server is installed.  
> See *SQL Server Setup* for step-by-step instructions.

## ⚡ Performance

### Benchmark Environment

All benchmarks were executed on **Windows 10 (22H2)** with an **Intel Core i9-9940X (14 cores / 28 threads)** using **.NET 8.0.21** and **BenchmarkDotNet v0.15.4**.  
Power plan: *High Performance*.  
Garbage Collector: *Concurrent Workstation*.

C++ reference results were gathered from the same system using a **Visual Studio x64 Release build** of [**bwedding/PokerEvalMultiThread**](https://github.com/bwedding/PokerEvalMultiThread) (*MSVC /O2 optimization, AVX2-capable CPU*).

### Verified Results (.NET 8)

| Benchmark (C# /.NET 8.0.21) | Mean (ns / op) | Mean (µs / op) | Description |
|------------------------------|---------------:|---------------:|--------------|
| **Optimized core evaluator (values-only, no allocs)** | ≈ 907 ns | 0.907 µs | Evaluates 9 players × 21 7-card combinations (values only) |
| **Core evaluator (9 players × 21 combos)** | ≈ 1 390 ns | 1.39 µs | Best-of-7 evaluation with ranks and scores |
| **Full 9-player showdown (including setup and scoring)** | ≈ 910 ns | 0.91 µs | End-to-end EvalEngine path |
| **Full 9-player evaluation + best-hand reconstruction** | ≈ 1 221.9 ns | 1.22 µs | Returns sorted winning hands for UI display |

Each full 9-player river evaluation covers **189 five-card combinations (9 × 21)**.

Allocation notes:
- The **optimized values-only path** shows no Gen0 collections during measurement, consistent with a zero-allocation hot path.
- Other benchmark variants (e.g., full evaluation or index/rank-producing paths) do perform small per-operation allocations, as reflected in their GC/Allocated reports.

> **Note:** “Values-only” benchmarks measure the raw numeric evaluation loop. “Full” benchmarks also build and sort winning hands for display.

### Verified Results (C++ Reference)

| Benchmark (C++ bwedding / Suffecool port) | Hands Tested | Time (s) | Hands / sec (M) | ns / hand |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------:|---------:|----------------:|----------:|
| **10 M 7-card hands** | 10,000,000 | 0.0529 | 188.94 M | 5.29 ns |
| **50 M 7-card hands** | 50,000,000 | 0.2686 | 186.17 M | 5.37 ns |
| **100 M 7-card hands** | 100,000,000 | 0.5326 | 187.74 M | 5.33 ns |

Checksums (e.g., `40971729725`) match across runs, confirming deterministic behavior.

---

### Observations

- The optimized .NET 8 build demonstrates consistent sub-microsecond operation for full 9-player evaluations and under 1 µs for the fastest paths.  
- C++ reference throughput averages **~186–189 million 7-card hands per second (≈ 5.3 ns/hand)** under MSVC /O2 AVX2 builds.  
- Both implementations produce identical hand distribution statistics and checksums, confirming algorithmic equivalence.

### 📚 Algorithm Lineage and Faithfulness

This evaluator is a modern **C# translation** of [Cactus Kev’s Poker Hand Evaluator](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib) —  
the classic C implementation that popularized **prime-number-based hand evaluation**.

All core logic is faithfully preserved:
- Flush and straight detection tables  
- Perfect-hash prime product encoding  
- Rank thresholds identical to Kev’s original  

Where Kev used C arrays, macros, and pointer arithmetic, **Poker.net** employs managed data structures, `Span<T>` buffers, and modern .NET 8 JIT optimizations to achieve equivalent throughput — **without huge in-memory lookup tables or unsafe code**.

Comprehensive validation confirms **one-to-one rank and frequency equivalence** with the original algorithm, and checksum tests verify that every evaluated hand produces identical results to the C reference.

### 2. Add PokerBenchmarks as Existing Project to poker.net

If you clone both repositories under a single `source` directory like this:

```
source/poker.net  
source/PokerBenchmarks
```

Then everything is already configured:

* `PokerBenchmarks` already includes the correct NuGet packages (`BenchmarkDotNet`)
* The project references are pre-wired for `poker.net`

Simply:

1. **Open the solution**
2. **Set `PokerBenchmarks` as the Startup Project**
3. **Build in Release mode**
4. Press **Ctrl + F5** to run the benchmarks

BenchmarkDotNet will automatically generate results under:

```
source/PokerBenchmarks/bin/Release/net8.0/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/
```
