[![Throughput](https://img.shields.io/badge/Throughput-~189M%20hands%2Fs-brightgreen)]()

A modern **.NET 8/9 implementation** of the legendary [**Cactus Kev Poker Evaluator**](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib), rebuilt from the ground up for clarity, determinism, and speed.  

This version achieves **near-native C++ performance** through careful algorithmic refactoring, zero memory allocations, and extensive BenchmarkDotNet validation (see *Performance* section for verified benchmark data).

**This repository showcases a fully optimized .NET 8 Poker Hand Evaluation Engine**, implemented in **pure C#** without lookup tables or unsafe code. Estimated throughput, based on derived five-card evaluation counts from recent benchmarks, corresponds to roughly **170‚Äì190 million evaluations per second**, depending on workload (see *Performance* section for logs).

_All benchmarks were performed on an Intel Core i9-9940X (14-core, 28-thread) running Windows 10 (22H2) with .NET 8.0.21 under the High-Performance power plan._

Ideal for developers exploring **algorithmic optimization**, **combinatorial evaluation**, or **.NET performance engineering**.

## About the Project


This project re-creates the logic and structure of a full **Texas Hold‚Äôem Poker** game ‚Äî from shuffling and dealing cards to evaluating hands and determining the winner.

The application is written in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and uses a modern C# port of [Cactus Kev‚Äôs Poker Hand Evaluator](https://poker-calculator.johnbelthoff.com/cactus_kev), the classic C implementation that popularized prime-number-based hand ranking.

At this stage, the app:

- Simulates **9 players**
- **Rotates the dealer**
- **Calculates the winning hand**
- **Displays detailed results**

Under the hood, the evaluation engine is optimized for high throughput and deterministic performance, maintaining fully managed, allocation-free execution.

---


## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

Clone and launch the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBelthoff/poker.net.git
cd poker.net
dotnet run
```

> **Tip:**  
> After running `dotnet run`, check the console log for the exact URL (‚ÄúNow listening on‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
> Then open that URL (usually `https://localhost:5001`) in your browser.  
>
> **Note:**  
> By default, the app runs in No-DB (Static) mode using an in-memory deck.  
> To enable SQL Server support for recording games, set `"UseSqlServer": true` in your configuration and ensure SQL Server is installed.  
> See *SQL Server Setup* for step-by-step instructions.

## ‚ö° Performance

### Benchmark Environment

All benchmarks were executed on **Windows 10 (22H2)** with an **Intel Core i9-9940X (14 cores / 28 threads)** using **.NET 8.0.21** and **BenchmarkDotNet v0.15.4**.  
Power plan: *High Performance*.  
Garbage Collector: *Concurrent Workstation*.

C++ reference results were gathered from the same system using a **Visual Studio x64 Release build** of [**bwedding/PokerEvalMultiThread**](https://github.com/bwedding/PokerEvalMultiThread) (*MSVC /O2 optimization, AVX2-capable CPU*).

### Verified Results (.NET 8)

| Benchmark (C# /.NET 8.0.21) | Mean (ns / op) | Mean (¬µs / op) | Description |
|------------------------------|---------------:|---------------:|--------------|
| **Optimized core evaluator (values-only, no allocs)** | 900 ns | 0.900 ¬µs | Core evaluation loop (values-only, zero allocations) |
| **Full 9-player evaluation (EvalEngine pipeline)** | 1 204 ns | 1.204 ¬µs | Complete 9-player best-hand evaluation |
| **Parallel.For batched (values-only)** | ‚Äî | 646.898 ms total | Parallel batch throughput test across multiple cores |

Each full 9-player river evaluation covers **189 five-card combinations (9 √ó 21)**.

Allocation notes:
- The **optimized values-only path** shows no Gen0 collections, confirming a zero-allocation inner loop.
- The **full 9-player evaluation** introduces minimal per-operation allocations, as reflected in GC/Allocated stats from BenchmarkDotNet.

> **Note:** ‚ÄúValues-only‚Äù benchmarks measure the pure numeric evaluation core. ‚ÄúFull‚Äù benchmarks include ranking and best-hand reconstruction for display.

### Verified Results (C++ Reference)

| Benchmark (C++ Reference / bwedding port) | Hands Tested | Time (s) | Hands / sec (M) | ns / hand |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------:|---------:|----------------:|----------:|
| **10 M 7-card hands** | 10,000,000 | 0.0524 | 190.72 M | 5.24 ns |
| **50 M 7-card hands** | 50,000,000 | 0.2651 | 188.60 M | 5.30 ns |
| **100 M 7-card hands** | 100,000,000 | 0.5308 | 188.39 M | 5.31 ns |

Checksums match across all C++ runs, confirming deterministic evaluation.

---

### Observations

- The **optimized .NET 8 evaluator** achieves **~900 ns per operation (0.9 ¬µs)** in its tightest path and **‚âà 1.2 ¬µs** for full 9-player evaluation.  
- The **C++ reference** achieves **~188‚Äì191 million 7-card hands/sec (~5.3 ns/hand)** under optimized `/O2 AVX2` builds.  
- These results show the **.NET 8 implementation performing within sub-microsecond parity** of the native C++ evaluator.

### üìö Algorithm Lineage and Faithfulness

This evaluator is a modern **C# translation** of [Cactus Kev‚Äôs Poker Hand Evaluator](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib) ‚Äî  
the classic C implementation that popularized **prime-number-based hand evaluation**.

All core logic is faithfully preserved:
- Flush and straight detection tables  
- Perfect-hash prime product encoding  
- Rank thresholds identical to Kev‚Äôs original  

Where Kev used C arrays, macros, and pointer arithmetic, **Poker.net** employs managed data structures, `Span<T>` buffers, and modern .NET 8 JIT optimizations to achieve equivalent throughput ‚Äî **without huge in-memory lookup tables or unsafe code**.

Comprehensive validation confirms **one-to-one rank and frequency equivalence** with the original algorithm, and checksum tests verify that every evaluated hand produces identical results to the C reference.

## üß™ Running Benchmarks Locally

To reproduce, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Required Repositories

| Repository                                                                          | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`poker.net`](https://github.com/JBelthoff/poker.net)                               | Core ASP.NET / C# evaluator (switch to the `optimization` branch) |
| [`PokerBenchmarks`](https://github.com/JBelthoff/PokerBenchmarks)                   | Standalone benchmark harness and verified results                 |
| [`bwedding/PokerEvalMultiThread`](https://github.com/bwedding/PokerEvalMultiThread) | Reference **C++** implementation                                  |
| [`suffecool/pokerlib`](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib)                       | Original **C** evaluator by Cactus Kev                            |

---

### 2. Add PokerBenchmarks as Existing Project to poker.net

If you clone both repositories under a single `source` directory like this:

```
source/poker.net  
source/PokerBenchmarks
```

Then everything is already configured:

* `PokerBenchmarks` already includes the correct NuGet packages (`BenchmarkDotNet`)
* The project references are pre-wired for `poker.net`

Simply:

1. **Open the solution**
2. **Set `PokerBenchmarks` as the Startup Project**
3. **Build in Release mode**
4. Press **Ctrl + F5** to run the benchmarks

BenchmarkDotNet will automatically generate results under:

```
source/PokerBenchmarks/bin/Release/net8.0/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/
```

## SQL Server Setup

> Skip this section if you're running in **No-DB (Static)** mode.

1. Create a SQL Server database named `PokerApp`.  
2. Create a Login and User for the database.  
3. Run the appropriate initialization script from the [`x_dBase`](x_dBase/) folder:
   - [`CreateDB-2019.sql`](x_dBase/CreateDB-2019.sql) ‚Äî for **SQL Server 2019 or earlier**  
   - [`CreateDB-2022.sql`](x_dBase/CreateDB-2022.sql) ‚Äî for **SQL Server 2022 and newer** (supports `STRING_SPLIT(@s, '|', 1)` and other modern features)  
4. Update your connection string (via `appsettings.json`, User Secrets, or environment variables).  
5. Set `"UseSqlServer": true` in your configuration.  
6. Build and run the project (`dotnet run`, Docker, or IIS Express).  
7. Visit the app in your browser and start playing!

>*The 2019 script maintains full backward compatibility down to SQL Server 2008 by using `datetime2` and the legacy `DelimitedSplit8K` function.  
The 2022 script reflects modern best practices per Davide Mauri (@yorek), including transaction safety (`XACT_ABORT ON`) and native `STRING_SPLIT` with ordinal output.*
