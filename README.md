**This repository showcases a fully optimized .NET 8 Poker Hand Evaluation Engine.**  
  
It benchmarks **‚âà 178 million 5-card evaluations per second** using **BenchmarkDotNet**, written entirely in **pure C#** without lookup tables or unsafe code.  
  
Ideal for developers studying **algorithmic optimization**, **combinatorial evaluation**, or **.NET performance engineering**.




## About the Project

This project re-creates the logic and structure of a full **Texas Hold‚Äôem Poker** game ‚Äî  
from shuffling and dealing cards to evaluating hands and determining the winner.

The application is written in **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and uses a modern C# port of  
[Cactus Kev‚Äôs Poker Hand Evaluator](https://poker-calculator.johnbelthoff.com/cactus_kev), the classic C implementation that popularized prime-number-based hand ranking.

At this stage, the app:

- Simulates up to **9 players**
- **Rotates the dealer**
- **Calculates the winning hand**
- **Displays detailed results**

Under the hood, the evaluation engine performs about **‚âà 178 million 5-card evaluations per second (single-threaded)**  
and scales up to **‚âà 2.76 billion hands per second (multi-threaded)** ‚Äî  
placing it within **‚âà 98 % of an AVX2-optimized C++ implementation** while preserving fully managed, allocation-free execution.

Future updates will continue refining gameplay and introduce interactive features such as  
hand histories, betting logic, and visualized probability analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

Clone and launch the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JBelthoff/poker.net.git
cd poker.net
dotnet run
```

> **Tip:**  
> After running `dotnet run`, check the console log for the exact URL (‚ÄúNow listening on‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
> Then open that URL (usually `https://localhost:5001`) in your browser.  
>
> **Note:**  
> By default, the app runs in No-DB (Static) mode using an in-memory deck.  
> To enable SQL Server support for recording games, set `"UseSqlServer": true` in your configuration and ensure SQL Server is installed.  
> See *SQL Server Setup* for step-by-step instructions.

## ‚ö° Performance

### Version Notes

Benchmarks were measured with **BenchmarkDotNet v0.15.4** on **.NET 8.0.21**,
running **Windows 10 (22H2)** on an **Intel Core i9-9940X (14 cores / 28 threads)**
under the *High Performance* power plan.

Both **.NET 8** and **.NET 9** produce statistically identical results,
confirming consistent JIT and runtime behavior across LTS and preview builds.

The **Optimization Branch (Version 2)** introduced Span-based memory reuse, tighter hot-path loops,
and complete allocation elimination, achieving performance within **‚âà 98 % of native C++**.
An upgrade to **.NET 10** is planned upon its release.

### Master Branch (Version 1) ‚Äî Raw Numbers

| Benchmark                              | Mean (¬µs/op) | Alloc/op | Derived 5-card Evals/sec (‚âà) |
| -------------------------------------- | -----------: | -------: | ---------------------------: |
| **End-to-End (9 players ‚Ä¢ best-of-7)** |    10.922 ¬µs |  8.26 KB |                  ‚âà 20 M /sec |
| **Engine-only (7-card ‚Üí best-of-21)**  |     1.643 ¬µs |    888 B |                 ‚âà 115 M /sec |

*Each full 9-player river evaluation involves 189 five-card combinations (9 √ó 21).*

### Optimization Branch (Version 2) vs Master (Version 1)

| Benchmark                              | Mean (¬µs/op) |    Derived Evals/sec (‚âà) |          Œî vs Master (%) | Notes                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | -----------: | -----------------------: | -----------------------: | ----------------------------------------- |
| **End-to-End (EvalEngine)**            |     1.066 ¬µs | ‚âà 940 M 5-card evals/sec |        **+927 % faster** | Major hot-path refactor, zero allocations |
| **Engine-only (7 ‚Üí 21)**               |     1.376 ¬µs | ‚âà 145 M 5-card evals/sec |         **+27 % faster** | Loop unrolling + `Span<T>` reuse          |
| **FinalRiver (Parallel, values-only)** |            ‚Äî |   **‚âà 2.76 B hands/sec** | **‚âà 13√ó faster overall** | Flattened Perm7, allocation-free          |

The Optimization Branch brought the managed engine from hundreds of millions
to **billions of evaluations per second**, closing the gap with native C.

### Optimization Branch (Version 2) vs Native C++

| Implementation                        | Toolchain                    | Runtime (s) / 10 M hands | Hands/sec (B) | % of C Speed |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -----------------------: | ------------: | -----------: |
| **Native C++ (bwedding / Suffecool)** | MSVC 19.44 / O2 + AVX2       |                 ‚âà 1.25 s |        2.80 B |        100 % |
| **.NET 8 Optimized (V2)**             | RyuJIT TieredPGO + Server GC |                 ‚âà 1.27 s |        2.76 B |   **‚âà 98 %** |

Both implementations produced identical deterministic checksums,
confirming algorithmic parity. The managed version now performs
within statistical noise of C++ speed.  
  
> **Note:** Results reflect this specific compute-bound algorithm (poker hand evaluation)  
> under identical logic and workload; not a general .NET vs C++ comparison.

### üìö Algorithm Lineage and Faithfulness

This evaluator is a modern **C# translation** of [Cactus Kev‚Äôs Poker Hand Evaluator](https://github.com/suffecool/pokerlib) ‚Äî  
the classic C implementation that popularized **prime-number-based hand evaluation**.

All core logic is faithfully preserved:
- Flush and straight detection tables  
- Perfect-hash prime product encoding  
- Rank thresholds identical to Kev‚Äôs original  

Where Kev used C arrays, macros, and pointer arithmetic, **Poker.net** employs managed data structures,  
`Span<T>` buffers, and modern .NET 8 JIT optimizations to achieve equivalent throughput ‚Äî  
**without huge in-memory lookup tables or unsafe code**.

Comprehensive validation confirms **one-to-one rank and frequency equivalence** with the original algorithm,  
and checksum tests verify that every evaluated hand produces identical results to the C reference.
